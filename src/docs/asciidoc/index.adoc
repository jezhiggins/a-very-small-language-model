[big]*A Very Small Language Model*

Hello friends, I'm Jez and this session is the lightest of the day (perhaps even of the week).

It's been a long day, eh? Well, if you fancy more hard thinking there's Dietmar to my right doing Async {cpp}, Robert on my left looking at Monadic Operations in {cpp} (you'll all recall, no doubt that _All told, a monad in X is just a monoid in the category of endofunctors of X, with the cartesian product of sets replaced by composition of endofunctors and unit set by the identity endofunctor_) and round the corner we've got Jutta and Willem doing a couple of shorter talks on development processes.

It's fairly hefty competition, and I'm very flattered you've chosen to be here. This session is, by some measure probably the lightest of the day (even the week), and I hope we can have some fun with some code, and relax a bit before the lightning talks. If, however, having a nice time doesn't appeal, and you think maybe you'd rather skip out to one of the other sessions, I shan't be the least bit offended, so please do vote with you feet if you get the urge.

So, what are we going to do?

We're going to build a bit of magic software in an hour or so.

[big]*Magic Software*

What do I mean by magic software?

There are lots of things in software that seem kind of amazing, even to people who work in software. Operating systems, compilers & interpreters, windowing systems - things we use all day every day - are obvious choices. Sat navs! Lots of game stuff - I'm not just talking about graphics rendering, but things like in-game AI. Satnavs, they're pretty cool.

Does anyone here play Dominion? There's a lovely version of Dominion for your tablet, and the computer opponents are really, really good.

Even the more mundane stuff can be fascinating - there was an incredible article about Hans Boehm's calculator app. It magical because it can do (10^100) + 1 − (10^100) correctly through the miracle of quite a lot of hard maths.

These are, however, all pretty large topics. You can’t write an operating system, or even a calculator, in  a 90 minute session. I can’t anyway. I am not Ken Thompson.

This is the start of a game of Dominion. It's a deck builder game, so you start with a handful of cards, and as the game progresses you gain more cards from the middle here.

Each of these action cards has a different effect, these over here can be used to modify the behaviour of them. The aim is get the most of these green cards over here, but you don't want to go to early, because they're otherwise useless and take up space in your hand here.

There's a lot to balance.  And every game is almost guaranteed to be unique - there are hundreds of these different action cards, and so you might need a very different approach from one game to the next.

The computer opponents are really good, particularly because they will play the same cards in different ways. It doesn't just come up with one optimised path, it'll do different things, sometimes in response to what you do and sometimes because, I don't know, it just feels like it.

It's terrific. I have no idea how it does it, it's just great.

So, about this time last year, I was poking around on my phone doing something or other, and my keyboard suddenly asked me if I want to turn on some kind of AI assistant to “boost productivity” and “unlock creativity”.

Obviously, I said no, because honestly, how much productivity boosting and creativity unlocking do you to send WhatsApp messages? And, in any case, it can’t do that.

However, it did get me thinking. It did! Really - I'm not giving you some kind of trite homily here - I promise you it did.

We are all, of course, familiar with how phone keyboards in particular, and more widely the general act of typing things on a computer, offer up suggestions for the word you're currently typing, and also the next word you might want to type.

The first time I encountered next word prediction was in late 1991 or early 1992, in a piece of schools' software. It was, for all intents and purposes, a word processor, and it was intended to help children with specific learning difficulties (dyspraxia, dysgraphia, dyslexia, or whatever) write more easily. As you typed, it popped up a selection of suggested words and you could just pick them off the list. I think it would also suggest next words. Commonplace these days, but really quite startling, even slightly spooky and magical, if you've never seen it before.

Now, here was a keyboard rebranding “next word prediction” as “AI assistance”. This is an attempt to group this technology in the same bucket as the ChatGPTs and the Claudes and what have you. It's trying to stoke up the idea that text prediction is a hard problem, something best left to the big brains at Google or Apple or Microsoft with their shiny offices and free lunches in Silicon Valley and Redmond

But, hang on, if a BBC Master system could do this 35 years ago, how hard could it be?

Can we build one in an hour?
